Term: asthma
Text about asthma:
Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to breathing difficulties. Common symptoms include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Triggers can vary but often include allergens, air pollution, exercise, and respiratory infections. Management typically involves a combination of long-term control medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, and quick-relief medications like short-acting beta-agonists. Recent research has focused on personalized treatment approaches, including biologics for severe asthma and the role of the microbiome in asthma development and progression. Proper inhaler technique and adherence to medication regimens are crucial for effective management. Asthma action plans, developed in partnership with healthcare providers, help patients manage symptoms and exacerbations.

Term: bronchoscopy
Text about bronchoscopy:
Bronchoscopy is a medical procedure used to examine the airways of the lungs. It involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called a bronchoscope through the nose or mouth into the trachea and bronchi. The procedure allows for direct visualization of the airways, collection of samples for biopsy or culture, and therapeutic interventions. Indications for bronchoscopy include persistent cough, abnormal chest X-ray findings, suspected lung cancer, and removal of foreign objects. It can be performed under local anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia. Recent advancements include endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for improved lymph node sampling and navigational bronchoscopy for accessing peripheral lung lesions. Complications, though rare, may include bleeding, pneumothorax, or respiratory distress. Bronchoscopy plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of various pulmonary conditions.

Term: albuterol
Text about albuterol:
Albuterol is a short-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonist commonly used in the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It works by relaxing smooth muscles in the airways, leading to bronchodilation and improved airflow. Albuterol is primarily administered via inhalation using a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) or nebulizer. It provides rapid relief of acute bronchospasm and is often used as a rescue medication. Common side effects include tremors, tachycardia, and nervousness. While effective for quick symptom relief, overuse of albuterol may indicate poor asthma control and the need for additional long-term control medications. Recent research has explored the use of combination inhalers containing albuterol and corticosteroids for improved asthma management. Proper inhaler technique is crucial for optimal drug delivery and efficacy.
